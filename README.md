Exploring time series and transformers for quantitative stock analysis.

# Done
- [x] Use AlphaVantage to download data
- [x] Use Time2Vec to enhance Transformer encoders to perform analysis.

# ToDo
- [ ] Clean up LSTM code.
- [ ] Try Temporal Fusion Transformers
- [ ] Try PatchTST 
- [ ] (Stretch w/ resources) Try Multi-Modal fusion. Use news data to enhance transformer (decoder or encoder).
